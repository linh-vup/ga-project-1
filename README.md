# ga-project-1

This ReadMe is WIP

## Description
This is the first solo project of my General Assembly remote Software Engineering Immersive course and my first big coding project. The project's task was to pick from a list of games and to develop the game based on the technologies/programming languages we have learned so far in the course (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).

I chose to build a game based on [Frogger][def], where the player has to navigate through a grid from one end to another while avoiding obstacles.

## Getting Started

## Timeframe

This project started four weeks into the SEI course and we were given one week to build the game. During that week, the class had daily morning stand-ups. As these were solo projects, I worked independently on the game. The instructors offered help when needed and there were Zoom breakout rooms for each project, where people basing their project on the same game could exchange information.
